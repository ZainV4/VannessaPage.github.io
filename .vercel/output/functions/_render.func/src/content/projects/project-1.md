In Esi Edugyan's *Washington Black*, the dialogue between Titch and Washington presents a stark reflection on themes of power, ownership, and the complexities of human relationships. The quote:

> “I shall ask my brother to release you permanently,” followed by Washington’s response, “Oh no, Titch, I would rather be your property” (pg. 105),

captures the painful reality of Washington's situation as an enslaved individual grappling with his identity and agency.

## Context of the Quote

This exchange occurs in a tense moment where Titch, who represents both a friend and a master, suggests the possibility of Washington’s freedom. However, Washington's chilling response reveals the depths of his despair and resignation. His willingness to remain "property" reflects a survival instinct shaped by a life of oppression, where the known is often perceived as safer than the unknown.

## Connections to Child Abuse

### The Illusion of Choice

Washington’s acceptance of being Titch’s property highlights a significant psychological theme often observed in cases of child abuse: the illusion of choice. Victims may feel trapped in their circumstances and may even choose to cling to an abusive relationship because it offers a semblance of stability. This quote illustrates how survivors of abuse can internalize their situations, perceiving a toxic bond as a preferable alternative to the uncertainty of independence.

### Power Imbalance

The dialogue starkly portrays the power dynamics at play between Titch and Washington. Titch, despite being a friend, holds dominion over Washington’s fate. In abusive relationships, this power imbalance is prevalent, with the abuser controlling the victim's options and perceptions. Washington's response suggests a tragic acceptance of his reality, mirroring the experiences of many who find themselves caught in cycles of abuse.

### Internalized Trauma

Washington's statement reflects the internalized trauma often experienced by abuse victims. By expressing a preference for being property, he conveys a sense of hopelessness that can accompany prolonged exposure to abuse. This resigned acceptance can hinder a victim's ability to envision a life beyond their current circumstances, further entrenching them in a cycle of victimization.

## Conclusion

Edugyan's *Washington Black* offers a poignant exploration of power, ownership, and the complex emotions intertwined in relationships marked by inequality. The quote illustrates the painful realities faced by those who are oppressed and the psychological mechanisms that emerge in response to trauma. By examining these themes, we gain insight into the broader implications of ownership and agency, particularly in the context of child abuse, where the line between safety and oppression often becomes tragically blurred.
