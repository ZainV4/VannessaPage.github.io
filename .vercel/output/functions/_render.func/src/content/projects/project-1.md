In Esi Edugyan’s *Washington Black*, a dialogue between Titch and Washington presents a theme of power, ownership, and the complexities of relationships. The quote:

> “I shall ask my brother to release you permanently,” followed by Washington’s response, “Oh no, Titch, I would rather be your property” (Edugyan 105),

captures the painful reality of Washington's situation as an enslaved individual grappling with his identity and agency.

## Context of the Quote

This conversation occurs in a tense moment where Titch, who sets himself up as both a friend, saviour, and a master. He suggests the possibility of Washington’s freedom; however, Washington’s response reveals the depths of his corrupted thought process. His willingness to remain reduced to a property reflects on his adverse experiences as a slave.


## Connections to Child Abuse

### The Illusion of Choice

Washington’s choice to be Titch’s property highlights a significant psychological theme often seen in cases of child abuse. Victims may feel trapped in their circumstances and choose to cling to an abusive relationship because it offers a sense of familiarity which can be seen in Washington throughout the book 

### Power Imbalance

This interaction portrays the power dynamics that are involved between Titch and Washington. Titch, despite acting as a friend, holds power over Washington’s fate. In abusive relationships, this power imbalance is very significant, with the abuser taking adavantage of the victim’s vulnerability and sense of self.

### Internalized Trauma

Washington’s statement reflects his internalized trauma. By saying he would rather be the property of Titch than Erasmus, he shows a sense of hopelessness that is a result of exposure to abuse. This hopelessness can hinder a victim’s ability to envision a life beyond their current circumstances, further engulfing them in the cycle of abuse.

## Conclusion

Esi Edugyan’s *Washington Black* explores power, ownership, and the emotions involved in relationships stunted by inequality. The quote illustrates the realities of those who are oppressed and the psychological consequences that can occur in response to trauma. By looking into these themes, we gain insight into the implications of ownership and personal autonomy in the context of child abuse.
