I sent you back to observe with Philip. He was not harmed. You should have been with him. I sent you back, Wash” (Edugyan 87),\n\nThis exchange encapsulates the essence of individuality and the struggle for acknowledgment in a world that often overlooks the inherent value of marginalized lives.\n\n## Context of the Quote\n\nThis momment occurs when Titch expresses his frustration towards Washington for being too close to the Cloud-Cutter leading him to be severly injured. The frustration suggests that he felt very disrespected by Wash’s negligance. Although, this scene proves to be very complicated as Titch also feels genuine concern. His concern lies in the fact that Washington is a tool and now that his tool is injured, how can he carry on with his scientific innovation? Beneth the concern is a personal vendetta that he feels the need to fulfill. \n\n\n\n## Connections to Child Abuse\n\n### Recognition as Healing\n\nIn the context of child abuse, recognizing a child’s talent can be a formative experience. Children who have faced abuse often havea sense of worthlessness. By acknowledging their individuality, it validates their experiences and potential, providing a crucial step toward healing. This quote serves as a reminder that every person has their own value, regardless of their past or current circumstances.\n\n\n### The Importance of Individuality\n\nThe emphasis on being a “rare person” highlights the importance of individuality. In abusive situations, children may feel defined by their experiences. Titch’s acknowledgment of Washington’s talent for drawing highlights the need to see beyond the abuse and recognize the person as a whole. This recognition can empower survivors to embrace their skills and other qualities beyond being a victim of abuse.\n\n### Complex Dynamics of Relationships\n\nThe relationship between Titch and Washington shows the challenges in relationships affected by trauma. While Titch’s words show a moment of his recognition of Wash, his power overshadows it. For victims of abuse, relationships can be clouded by poor judgement towards those who acknowledge their worth leading them to be misled by ther abusers true intentions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn **Washington Black*, Esi Edugyan’s exploration of identity through the recognition of uniqueness speaks volumes about the human experiences. The quote “you were a rare thing” serves as a reminder to affirm each individual’s value, especially in the context of child abuse. Recognizing one’s uniqueness is a step towards healing.\n";
