A rare person.” (Edugyan 405).\n\nThis exchange explores the concept of individuality and the struggle for acknowledgment in a world that often overlooks marginalized groups. \n\n## Context of the Quote\n\nThis quote occurs at a pivotal moment in the story when Titch and Washington finally reunite. Titch recognizes Washington’s uniqueness, calling him a “rare thing.” This lack of  acknowledgment of Wash’s humanity is disheartning, where he is often seen as a “thing” rather than a human being with his own identity and freedom.\n\n\n\n## Connections to Child Abuse\n\n### Recognition as Healing\n\nIn the context of child abuse, recognizing a child’s talent can be a formative experience. Children who have faced abuse often havea sense of worthlessness. By acknowledging their individuality, it validates their experiences and potential, providing a crucial step toward healing. This quote serves as a reminder that every person has their own value, regardless of their past or current circumstances.\n\n\n### The Importance of Individuality\n\nThe emphasis on being a “rare person” highlights the importance of individuality. In abusive situations, children may feel defined by their experiences. Titch’s acknowledgment of Washington’s talent for drawing highlights the need to see beyond the abuse and recognize the person as a whole. This recognition can empower survivors to embrace their skills and other qualities beyond being a victim of abuse.\n\n### Complex Dynamics of Relationships\n\nThe relationship between Titch and Washington shows the challenges in relationships affected by trauma. While Titch’s words show a moment of his recognition of Wash, his power overshadows it. For victims of abuse, relationships can be clouded by poor judgement towards those who acknowledge their worth leading them to be misled by ther abusers true intentions. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn *Washington Black*, Esi Edugyan’s exploration of identity through the recognition of uniqueness speaks volumes about the human experiences. The quote “you were a rare thing” serves as a reminder to affirm each individual’s value, especially in the context of child abuse. Recognizing one’s uniqueness is a step towards healing.\n";
