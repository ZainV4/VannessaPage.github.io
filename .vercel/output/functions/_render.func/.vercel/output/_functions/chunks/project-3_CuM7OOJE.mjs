I sent you back to observe with Philip” (Edugyan 87),\n\nhighlights the conflicting feelings between Titch and Washington but also Titch’s emotional response, which is a sense of dipleasure.\n\n## Context of the Quote\n\nThis momment occurs when Titch expresses his frustration towards Washington for being too close to the Cloud-Cutter leading him to be severly injured. The frustration suggests that he felt very disrespected by Wash’s negligance. Although, this scene proves to be very complicated as Titch also feels genuine concern. His concern lies in the fact that Washington is a tool and now that his tool is injured, how can he carry on with his scientific innovation? Beneth the concern is a personal vendetta that he feels the need to fulfill. \n\n## Connections to Child Abuse\n\n### Frustration as a Tool of Control\n\nTitch’s frustration toward Washington can be viewed as a tool for emotional manipulation, a tactic often used by abusers to reinforce power. In abusive relationships, the abuser may guilt-trip the victim as a projection of their frustration, creating a very toxic and controlling environment. This tactic can lead victims truly believing they were in the wrong and leading them to blame themselves. This can cause a low self-esteem and normalizes the abusive behaviours being inflicted on them because they may not realiezed they are being guilt-tripped. \n\n### The Impact of Power Imbalance\n\nThe quote illustrates the significant power imbalance in their relationship, where Titch’s disapointment trump's Washington’s health and well-being as he has just experienced a very physically traumatic momment. This is mirrored in many abusive situations, where the abuser’s emotions dictate the victims well-being and overall circumstances. \n\n### The Psychological Toll\n\nSince Titch has significant control over Washington’s state of mind, experiencing this disdain from someone who has a big influence on him can lead to Washington questioning his own value and abilities to be an assistant. This often causes the victims to have very low confidence in themselves. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nThrough this quote, Esi Edugyan effectively shows the intricases of Titch and Washington’s relationship, emphasizing how Titch’s own emotions are used as a tool for control over any given situation. This mirrors the emotional manipulation tactics in many abusive relationships. By examining these themes, we can better understand the lasting psychological effects. \n";
