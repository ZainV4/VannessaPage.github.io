No one was there most of the time, and even when they were, they weren't properly there. They were out of it. It was just hell.\"\n\nSophie’s story reflects a haunting reality for many children enduring neglect. She recounts the isolation she felt, explaining how her mother, frequently under the influence, wouldn’t even notice if she went to school. For Sophie, school offered a reprieve — a place to escape her home life. She describes trying to maintain a facade of happiness with friends, attempting to convince herself that everything was okay, if only for a moment.\n\n> \"I was often left by myself and felt so lonely. Even when mum and dad were in the house, they just weren't there mentally.\"\n\nOne of her lowest moments came when Sophie tried to confront her parents about their drug use. Their denial and anger only deepened her despair, leading her to feel utterly hopeless and alone.\n\n## Finding Support and Learning It Wasn’t Her Fault\n\nIt was only through intervention by the NSPCC that Sophie found hope. The NSPCC staff recognized her struggle through her body language and helped her open up in a safe space. Their support gave her the confidence to express her emotions and understand that she was not to blame for her parents’ actions.\n\n> \"The NSPCC took the time and trouble to get to know me. I didn't have to re-tell my story every time. We just picked up where we left off.\"\n\nThrough creative exercises and discussions, Sophie learned about making positive choices for herself, steering her away from the path her mother had taken. Today, she lives independently and is planning to attend university, a future she once thought impossible.\n\n## How You Can Help\n\nThe NSPCC provides therapeutic services to children like Sophie, supports parents and families, and works with professionals and communities to prevent abuse and neglect.
