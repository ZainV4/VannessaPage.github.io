In Esi Edugyan's *Washington Black*, the quote:

> “What were you doing standing so close for? I sent you back to observe with Philip” (Edugyan 87),

highlights not only the hierarchical relationship between Titch and Washington but also Titch's emotional response, which includes a sense of disgust that reveals deeper themes of power and control.

## Context of the Quote

This moment occurs when Titch expresses irritation and disapproval towards Washington for being too close. The frustration suggests that Titch perceives Washington's proximity as inappropriate or invasive, reflecting a discomfort that transcends mere annoyance. This discomfort can be understood as a manifestation of Titch's internalized beliefs about race and class, where Washington's presence is a reminder of his position within a social hierarchy that Titch is reluctant to confront.

## Connections to Child Abuse

### Disgust as a Tool of Control

Titch's disgust toward Washington can be viewed as a form of emotional manipulation, a tactic often employed by abusers to reinforce power dynamics. In abusive relationships, the abuser may express contempt or revulsion towards the victim, creating an environment of shame and devaluation. This response can lead victims to internalize negative feelings about themselves, believing they are unworthy or undeserving of respect and kindness.

### The Impact of Power Imbalance

The quote illustrates the significant power imbalance in their relationship, where Titch's discomfort serves to assert dominance over Washington. This dynamic is reminiscent of many abusive situations, where the abuser's emotional reactions dictate the victim's behavior and sense of self-worth. Washington’s role as an observer highlights his subservient position, making him vulnerable to Titch’s fluctuating emotions and attitudes.

### The Psychological Toll

Titch’s disgust can have profound implications for Washington's psyche. Experiencing rejection or disdain from someone who holds power over him could lead Washington to question his own value and worthiness. This internal conflict is common among victims of abuse, who often grapple with feelings of shame and inadequacy instilled by their abusers. 

## Conclusion

Through this quote, Edugyan effectively conveys the uncomfortable dynamics of Titch and Washington's relationship, emphasizing Titch's emotional response as a tool of control and devaluation. The disgust that Titch expresses serves to reinforce the power imbalance inherent in their interactions, mirroring the emotional manipulation present in many abusive relationships. By examining these themes, we can better understand the lasting psychological effects of such dynamics, particularly on those who are marginalized and oppressed.
